/**
 * The managed block records the MCP command so a human — or an agent reading
 * the file it is written into — can see how xtctx is wired. It is the one
 * place in the block that claims something runnable, and it was wrong.
 *
 * `portablePath` rewrites a path inside the project root to a `./`-relative
 * one, because the block lands in committed files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md,
 * GEMINI.md) where an absolute path names a directory on exactly one machine.
 * But it ran over *every* argument, and `relative()` resolves a bare `-y`
 * against the process cwd. So whenever setup ran from inside the project it
 * was configuring — which is what `cd project && npx -y xtctx setup` does —
 * the flag came out as `./-y` and the block advertised `npx ./-y ./xtctx`.
 *
 * Two costs, and the second is the reason this is worth a test. The command
 * does not exist, so anyone who copies it gets an error. And the output
 * depends on cwd, so re-running setup from a different directory rewrites a
 * committed file — churn in a diff that has nothing to do with the change.
