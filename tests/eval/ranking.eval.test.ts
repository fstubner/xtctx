/**
 * Retrieval ranking eval.
 *
 * Nothing else in this repo measures whether search is any *good* — the unit
 * tests assert that a query returns the one session that exists, which passes
 * for almost any ranking. This indexes a corpus where many sessions discuss
 * the same topics and exactly one answers each query, then scores the result
 * order against a committed baseline.
 *
 * It runs the real embedding model against the real SQLite index, so it is
 * slow and deliberately kept out of `npm test`:
 *
 *   npm run test:eval                              compare against baseline
 *   XTCTX_UPDATE_EVAL_BASELINE=1 npm run test:eval  rewrite the baseline
 *
 * A metric may drift down by TOLERANCE before the gate fails; anything worse
 * is a regression that needs an explanation in the PR that causes it.

 * keyword hit on anything else was invisible. Vectorizing is budgeted and runs
 * eight windows at a time on semantic searches only, so a partly-embedded
 * index is the ordinary state — this project sat at 8 vectorized windows out
 * of 1,770 — and hybrid is the default mode agents call.
 *
 * Measured before the fix, hybrid recall tracked coverage almost exactly while
 * keyword held 0.850 throughout:
 *
 *   coverage   hybrid recall@5   keyword recall@5
 *      100%         0.933             0.850
