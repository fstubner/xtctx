/**
 * What the MCP server does in the background after it starts.

 * This logic lived in `cli/index.ts`, which runs `main()` on import, so no test
 * could reach it — and a mutation sweep found three changes to it that the
 * whole suite let through: ignoring the drain budget, calibrating with
 * embeddings disabled, and (found by review rather than mutation) an ordering
 * that meant calibration never applied to the session that ran it.
