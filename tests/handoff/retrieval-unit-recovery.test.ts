/**
 * Retrieval units are what search reads. They are rebuilt only for the
 * sessions a scan touched, at the end, after every scraper has finished —
 * while each scraper advances its own cursor as soon as it finishes, and the
 * CLI exits two seconds after stdin closes on every client disconnect.
 *
 * A scan that dies in that gap leaves messages committed and the cursor past
 * them, so nothing re-reads them and the units are never rebuilt. The messages
 * stay reachable through `xtctx_session_detail` and invisible to both keyword
 * and semantic search — a silent hole, because the session looks fine.
 *
 * `reconcileSessionRollups` already repairs `message_count` for exactly this
 * gap. There was no counterpart for units, and the maintainer's own index
 * carried 1,343 and 356 uncovered messages in its two live sessions.
