/**
 * A config that will not parse is not an empty project.
 *
 * `.xtctx/config.yaml` records which transcript stores the user allowed to be
 * read, so a file that cannot be parsed yields zero scrapers rather than
 * defaults — which is the right call, and it meant every MCP tool answered
 * "No matching sessions found." An agent reads that as "this project has no
 * cross-tool history" and tells the user so, while the real answer is "xtctx
 * is reading nothing at all until you fix one file".
 *
 * `xtctx status` has printed `UNREADABLE` for a while. Agents never run the
 * CLI, and the MCP surface is the only one they see.
