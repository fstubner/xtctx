/**
 * Every transcript-derived or caller-supplied value an MCP tool prints,
 * checked one at a time.
 *
 * The fence protects message *bodies*. Everything else — headings, the
 * `- Field: value` lines, the retrieve hints — prints outside it, so a
 * newline in any of those forges a line at the start of a line. Several were
 * neutralised and several were not, and the ones that were not were found one
 * round at a time: first `preview`, then `source_path` and `source_pointer`,
 * then `session_ref` and `git_commit`, then the manifest's copies of both.
 *
 * So this file enumerates rather than samples. A new field printed outside
 * the fence belongs here whether or not anyone can currently reach it.
