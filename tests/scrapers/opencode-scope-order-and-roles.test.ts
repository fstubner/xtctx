/**
 * Four opencode behaviours that a mutation sweep found nothing defending.
 *
 * The existing suite builds its fixture database with `directory TEXT NOT
 * NULL`, so the case the fail-closed filter exists for — a session row with a
 * null `directory` — could not occur in any test. Admitting those rows serves
 * conversations that nothing has attributed to this project, and they are
 * stamped with this project's root on the way into the index, so the index's
 * own filter cannot catch them afterwards.
 *
 * A message's own recorded time beats the row's. They are usually the same;
 * when they are not, reading only the row can place a message *before* the
 * incremental cutoff that has already passed, and it is then never emitted
 * again — a permanent loss with no signal.
 *
 * A message below the cutoff still consumes a message index, or the same turn
 * gets one index on a full sync and another on an incremental one. Chunk ids
 * hash the index, so that re-emits it under a second id rather than
 * deduplicating against what is stored.
 *
 * And a message whose `role` field has gone must be skipped, not defaulted.
 * `normalizeRole` maps anything unrecognised to "system", so emitting the
 * record anyway silently relabels every turn in the store as system context on
 * the day the field is renamed.
