/**
 * Publishing to npm is irreversible — a version cannot be unpublished, only
 * deprecated — so what triggers a release is a safety property, not a
 * convenience.
 *
 * Two shapes have failed here. First, `publish` fired on `release: published`
 * while release-please marked releases as drafts, so a draft published
 * nothing. That worked and broke the release process: GitHub's
 * `releases/latest` endpoint hides drafts, release-please read it to find the
 * last release, so it saw the last pre-draft version forever, proposed a
 * release covering the entire history, auto-merge landed it, and the resulting
 * draft was invisible again. Fifty-four versions in an hour.
 *
 * Second, with drafts gone, merging any `fix:`/`feat:` PR opened a release PR
 * that another workflow auto-merged within seconds — so merging a change was
 * itself a release. Five versions went out between 09:34 and 16:58 on
 * 2026-08-30, none of them awaited. A per-day ceiling was tried and was the
 * wrong shape; the automatic path was removed instead.
 *
 * What replaced both: one manual `release` workflow that cuts and publishes,
 * and `publish` reachable on its own for a version tagged earlier. These tests
 * assert that shape and, more importantly, the absence of any way back to an
 * automatic one.
