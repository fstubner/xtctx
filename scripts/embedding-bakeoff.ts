/**
 * Score an embedding model against the eval corpus, at several thresholds.
 *
 * `docs/embedding-performance.md` records a bake-off that found bge-small
 * beating MiniLM once each model is judged at its own thresholds, and says
 * plainly that those rows cannot be reproduced: they were measured with
 * scratch scripts against a temporarily patched constant, and the eval harness
 * "runs one fixed provider and has no way to select a model or vary a
 * threshold". That made the strongest result in the file the least checkable
 * thing in it.
 *
 * This is that missing harness. It reuses the eval's own corpus and scoring so
 * a row here is comparable with `tests/eval/results/ranking-baseline.json`,
 * which is also the control: running this on the default model at the default
 * thresholds must reproduce the committed baseline, or the two are measuring
 * different things and nothing else here can be trusted.
 *
 * The thresholds sweep for free. They are applied at query time, not at embed
 * time, so one indexing pass per model serves every threshold pair — which is
 * what makes a sweep affordable at all, since embedding the corpus is the
 * expensive part.
 *
 * ONE MODEL PER PROCESS. Two providers in one process fail intermittently with
 * `bad allocation`, and two in separate vitest workers killed a worker
 * outright (issue #101).
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/embedding-bakeoff.ts --model=Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
 *   npx tsx scripts/embedding-bakeoff.ts --model=Xenova/bge-small-en-v1.5
