/**
 * Every tracked file belongs to exactly one review layer.
 *
 * Five audits of this repository each found a layer the previous one had not
 * looked at: code defects, then tests that could not fail, then release gates
 * that could not fail, then documentation and a landing page making claims the
 * code refuses. None of those passes was shallow. Each one was simply pointed
 * somewhere the last had not pointed, and nobody could say where that was,
 * because the list of places lived in whoever was reviewing.
 *
 * So the list lives here instead, and this script makes it answerable: a file
 * matching no layer fails, which turns "did we look everywhere" from a memory
 * question into a command. Adding a directory to the repository forces a
 * decision about who reviews it and what question they ask of it.
 *
 * It does NOT check that a review happened or was any good. It checks that the
 * map has no blank regions — the specific failure that recurred five times.
