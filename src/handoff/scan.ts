 * is stale. A resumed read starts past that point and is never eligible —
 * pruning on one would delete the whole history before its resume point.
 *
 * The obvious signal, "the scan wrote index 0", is wrong and was tried: every
 * scraper advances `messageIndex` over records it skips, so a real session's
 * lowest written position is whatever survived the skipping. Across nine real
 * Codex sessions those minima were 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5 and 5 — never 0, so
 * that version of this prune never ran on real data while its test, whose
 * fixture started at 0, passed.
