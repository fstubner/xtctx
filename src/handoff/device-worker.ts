/**
 * Time one embedding device, in a process of its own, and print the result.
 *
 * Spawned by `calibrateEmbeddingDevice`. It is a separate process because two
 * providers in one process fail intermittently with `bad allocation`, and a
 * device that cannot initialise has to be a measurement rather than a crash in
 * the caller.
 *
 * Spawned by path, so it has to exist wherever it is spawned from: `tsc`
 * emits it to `dist/src/handoff/device-worker.js` for the published package,
 * and `workerArgv` in device.ts spawns the `.ts` through tsx when running from
 * source. A plain `.js` file here would be simpler to spawn and would never
 * reach `dist` at all, because the build is `tsc` over the `src` tree and
 * copies nothing.
