    // handoff actually reaches for is covered long before the archive is.

   * dies in that gap leaves the messages committed, the cursor past them, and

   * `xtctx_session_detail`, invisible to search, and never repaired because
   * nothing re-reads the store.
   *
   * `reconcileSessionRollups` above handles the same gap for `message_count`.
   * This is its counterpart, and the two run together for the same reason: at
   * the start, so the repair survives an interruption of the same kind.
   *
   * Bounded per scan. Rebuilding reads every message in a session, and scans
   * here are routinely cut short, so an unbounded pass over a large backlog
   * would spend the whole scan and be killed before finishing. Most-recently

   * is covered before the archive is, and the backlog drains over a few scans.
