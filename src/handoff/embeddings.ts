/**
 * The embedding model, chosen on retrieval quality once indexing cost stopped
 * being the binding constraint.
 *
 * bge-small-en-v1.5, at the thresholds on `MIN_SEMANTIC_COSINE` and
 * `MIN_CONFIDENT_COSINE`, against MiniLM at the ones it replaced. Measured
 * 2026-09-21 with `scripts/embedding-bakeoff.ts`, sixty queries, both at a
 * false-positive rate of zero:
 *
 *              hybrid                     vector
 *              mrr    recall@5  top1      mrr    recall@5  top1
 *   MiniLM     0.333  0.533     0.183     0.246  0.350     0.183
 *   bge-small  0.417  0.583     0.267     0.398  0.533     0.317
 *
 * Reproduce either row by running that script; its MiniLM row at 0.15/0.36
 * reproduces `tests/eval/results/ranking-baseline.json` exactly, which is what
 * establishes that it and `ranking.eval.test.ts` measure the same thing.
 *
 * THRESHOLDS DO NOT TRANSFER BETWEEN MODELS, and this is the trap. At MiniLM's
 * 0.15/0.36, bge-small scores a false-positive rate of 1.00 — every
 * deliberately unanswerable query, gibberish included, returns something. It is
 * not the worse model there; it places its cosine values higher, so a floor
 * tuned to MiniLM's distribution excludes nothing. Any future model change has
 * to re-sweep, and the sweep is the whole job.
 *
 * What changed to allow this is cost, not quality. bge-small indexes the eval
 * corpus in 27.5s against MiniLM's 15.6s, about 1.8x, and that ratio is why
 * this was rejected when first measured on 2026-09-20. Device calibration
 * (`device.ts`) then made embedding roughly six times faster on a machine with
 * a GPU, and the MCP server began draining the backlog in the background, so
 * 1.8x of a much smaller number stopped being the deciding term.
 *
 * The caveat the earlier measurement carried still stands: the corpus is
 * synthetic and sixty queries. What is stronger now is that the margin holds
 * across three modes and every threshold pair swept, rather than resting on a
 * single row.
 *
 * Both models are 384 dimensions, so nothing about the schema changes.
 * `dropVectorsFromOtherModels` keys on the model name, so upgrading discards
 * every existing vector and re-embeds — which is the cost of this change and
 * is paid once per project.
 *
 * TWO REJECTIONS WORTH KEEPING, because the arguments for them are strong and
 * the reasons they lose are not obvious.
 *
 * mpnet-q8 was the default for a day, on a table that measured only half the
 * question. What it left out is what embedding actually costs, and the figure
 * used at the time — 18ms per embed — came from benchmarking strings like
 * "warm query number 5". A real segment is 1024 characters, the model's full
 * sequence window, and costs far more. Back to back over 291 real segments
 * from this project's index, mpnet first:
 *
 *   mpnet q8      ~360ms per segment
 *   MiniLM fp32   ~116ms per segment
 *
 * The absolute figures move with what else the process has loaded; the ratio
 * is the durable part, and it favoured MiniLM by three times or better.
 * Measure throughput on real content before moving this again; a per-embed
 * figure taken on short strings says nothing about it.
 *
 * A static model was measured on 2026-09-03 and rejected.
 *
 * Model2Vec statics (`minishlab/potion-base-8M`, 256 dimensions, 30MB) have no
 * transformer forward pass: they look each token's vector up and mean-pool. On
 * 291 real segments from this project's own index, mean 900 characters:
 *
 *   potion-base-8M   1.0ms per segment
 *   MiniLM fp32     71.4ms per segment
 *
 * Seventy times faster, and it loads in about a second rather than minutes on
 * a cold cache — which would remove the warm budget, the vector backlog and
 * the disabled-embeddings switch the test suite needs. It still loses, badly:
 * vector mode fell from mrr 0.246 to 0.016 and recall@5 from 0.350 to 0.033.
 * Hybrid held up at 0.273 only because keyword carries it.
 *
 * Not a threshold artefact — swept at 0.15, 0.25 and 0.45 the vector numbers
 * were identical to three decimals. The cause is length. Mean-pooling every
 * token washes out as text grows, measured on one query against a target and
 * a distractor padded with filler:
 *
 *   margin at ~0 chars     potion 0.714   MiniLM 0.723
 *   margin at ~500 chars   potion 0.148   MiniLM 0.471
 *   margin at ~3000 chars  potion 0.023   MiniLM 0.000
 *
 * Both collapse eventually; potion collapses at the length this project
 * actually embeds. A window here is eight messages.
 *
 * That suggested one more experiment: if length is the problem, the static
 * model should recover at shorter windows, and a 70x cheaper model is exactly
 * what would make short windows affordable. Measured on 2026-09-03, vector
 * mode, same sixty queries:
 *
 *   size/stride   potion   MiniLM
 *   8/4           0.016    0.246
 *   4/2           0.044    0.331
 *   2/1           0.097    0.461
 *
 * The diagnosis holds — potion climbs monotonically as the windows shrink —
 * and the conclusion does not change, because MiniLM climbs faster. The gap
 * widens rather than closes: 0.23 at 8/4, 0.36 at 2/1. There is no window size
 * at which the static model is the better choice here, so this is closed
 * rather than merely deferred.
 *
 * What the control did turn up is about windows, not models: MiniLM at 4/2 and
 * 2/1 is markedly better in `vector` mode than at the current 8/4. That is
 * recorded on `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE`, where the decision belongs.

 *
 * `scripts/probe-batch-size.mjs` embeds uniform 1000-character segments and
 * said the GPU wanted the largest batch available: 4.0ms/segment at 128
 * against 5.3 at 32, a 1.37x win that reproduced across runs. Acting on it
 * would have been a 5x REGRESSION. Measured instead by running
 * `xtctx scan --embed` over this project's own index from an empty vector
 * table, 150 seconds each on DirectML:
 *
 *   batch      ms/window
 *   8          123.4
 *   16         107.8, 107.9
 *   32         123.4
 *   128        542.9
 *
 * The benchmark's segments were all exactly the same length. Real ones are
 * not — windows hold a median of 4 segments and a 95th percentile of 17, of
 * varying size — and a batch is padded to its longest member, so a wide batch
 * of mixed lengths spends most of its work on padding. Uniform inputs hide
 * the dominant cost of the real workload entirely.
 *
 * This is the same mistake as the "18ms per embed" figure recorded on
 * `DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, which was taken on strings like "warm query
 * number 5" and drove a model change that had to be reverted. Measure this on
 * real content, through the real path, or do not move it.
 *
 * One constant, not one per device. An earlier version of this change made it
 * device-dependent on the strength of the benchmark above; the real-path
 * measurement removed the reason. The independent CPU measurement in
 * `docs/embedding-performance.md` — also taken on real segments from this
 * index — put 16 ahead of 32 by 10-20%, which is the same answer and the same
 * margin as the GPU rows above.
