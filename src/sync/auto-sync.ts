 * Keep an opted-in project's uploads current while the MCP server runs.
 *
 * Transcripts only change while an agent is running, and an agent with xtctx
 * wired runs this server for the whole session, so syncing from here is as
 * fresh as a separate daemon was without leaving a process behind. A crash
 * loses at most the last interval, which the next start uploads.
 *
 * Each tick asks `runDiffSync`, which refuses unless someone is logged in and
 * the project is opted in, so a project that is neither costs two small file
 * reads per tick and sends nothing. Ticks never overlap: the next is
 * scheduled when the previous one finishes. Across processes (two agents
 * open in one project each run a server) a lock in ~/.xtctx lets one upload
 * at a time; the others find it busy and wait for their next tick.
