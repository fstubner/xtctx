 * Whether a VS Code workspace belongs to this project.
 *
 * Cursor and GitHub Copilot both store their history under VS Code's
 * `workspaceStorage` layout: a directory per workspace holding a
 * `state.vscdb` beside a `workspace.json` naming the folder it was opened on.
 * That file is the only evidence of which project a workspace belongs to, so
 * this is the filter that keeps one project's conversations out of another's
 * answers — for two scrapers, from one place.
 *
 * It was two places. The function was byte-identical in `cursor.ts` and
 * `copilot/scraper.ts` with nothing in either saying a second copy existed,
 * which for a boundary check means a fix or a hardening could land on one
 * scraper and silently not the other.
 *
 * Fails closed throughout: an unreadable or malformed `workspace.json`, or one
 * naming no folder, is not evidence that the workspace is ours.

/**
 * Every path a WSL workspace URI could name, for whichever side xtctx runs on.
 *
 * VS Code and Cursor record a folder opened through WSL as
 * `vscode-remote://wsl%2B<distro>/mnt/h/projects/app`, never as a `file:` URL.
 * Nothing decoded that, and a URI compared against a path never matches, so
 * those workspaces were invisible — with no drift warning and no empty result,
 * because a workspace that does not match is indistinguishable from one
 * belonging to another project.
 *
 * Two readings, because the same URI means two things depending on where this
 * process is running:
 *
 * - The POSIX path itself, for xtctx running inside that distro, where the
 *   project root *is* `/mnt/h/projects/app`. This never matched either: the
 *   comparison saw the whole URI, scheme and authority included.
 * - Its Windows equivalent, for xtctx running on the host. `/mnt/<drive>` is
 *   WSL's documented default automount root, confirmed on the machine this was
 *   measured on: no `[automount]` section in `/etc/wsl.conf`, and `H:\ on
 *   /mnt/h` in the live mount table.
 *
 * Nothing is offered for:
 *
 * - Any authority that is not `wsl+`. `ssh-remote`, `dev-container` and
 *   `codespaces` name other machines — that store held 9 such workspaces for
 *   Cursor and 5 for VS Code — and mapping one onto a local root would serve a
 *   different computer's conversations as this project's.
 * - The bare `/<drive>/…` shape left by an `automount root = /` configuration.
 *   It appears 17 times in each tool's store here and every one of those
 *   workspaces holds zero conversations, so translating it would add this
 *   design's only ambiguity — a single-letter Linux directory that looks like
 *   a drive letter — in exchange for nothing. The POSIX reading above still
 *   covers it for anyone running inside WSL.
