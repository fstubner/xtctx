/**
 * True when the project being set up is the xtctx package itself.
 *
 * Setting xtctx up inside its own repo is the one case where `npx -y xtctx`
 * is actively wrong. npx resolves the *local* package, and installing it runs
 * `prepare` — which is `npm run build`, which begins by deleting `dist/`. The
 * SessionStart hook therefore wiped the very file the MCP server config points
 * at, and a client spawning the server in that window got "Connection closed".
 * It also meant the hook ran whatever npx had cached rather than the working
 * tree, so a developer could be debugging output no longer in their source.
 *
 * What the branch decides is which code gets configured to run: as an MCP
 * server, as a SessionStart hook command, and — through Antigravity — in a
 * *machine-global* config that outlives the project setup ran in. So the
 * question it answers is a trust question, and `package.json` cannot answer
 * it. Name and `bin` are just strings in a file, and every file in a cloned
 * repository is attacker-controlled; a hostile checkout that copied them
 * nominated its own `dist/src/cli/index.js` and xtctx wired it up.
 *
 * The authenticating step is the third check: the built entry point has to be
 * the file this process is *already executing*. That grants no new trust —
 * the operator ran this code to get here — while a checkout merely claiming
 * the name grants all of it. It also happens to be the precise condition the
 * npx problem needs, since running from `dist/` is what someone developing
 * xtctx does.
 *
 * Fails closed: anything unresolvable picks npx, which is always safe.
