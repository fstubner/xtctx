 * Nobody needs to run this. Both automatic paths cover it: `xtctx scan
 * --embed` calibrates before a long embed, and the MCP server calibrates at
 * start when it finds a backlog and no verdict, applying the result to the
 * not-yet-loaded provider in the same session.
 *
 * It stays as a command for the two things automation cannot do: `--force`
 * after the hardware changes, and showing the measurements to someone who
 * wants to see them. It is not a step in getting set up, and nothing should
 * tell a user it is.
 *
 * Still never behind an agent's tool call. That line is about where the cost
 * lands, not about whether it is automatic: both automatic callers are
 * background work that was already going to take minutes.
