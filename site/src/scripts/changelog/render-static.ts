/**
 * Render the release list at build time, using the same renderer the browser
 * uses.
 *
 * The page used to ship "Loading release notes..." and paint the notes in
 * from script. Everything needed was already known at build time — the
 * entries come from the repo's own CHANGELOG.md — so a crawler or a reader
 * without JavaScript got an empty page whose entire purpose is release
 * notes.
 *
 * Running the real renderer under a build-time DOM, rather than writing a
 * second server-side one, is deliberate: the card markup sits on top of ~400
 * lines of markdown-to-DOM conversion, and two copies of that would drift
 * apart quietly. The one thing skipped is the disclosure that collapses long
 * cards, which measures `scrollHeight` and so needs a laid-out page; the
 * client attaches it on load. That also means the no-JS rendering shows
 * every entry in full, which is the better failure direction.
