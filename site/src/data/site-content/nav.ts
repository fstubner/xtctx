 * (components/starlight/MobileMenuFooter.astro). Each used to carry its own
 * copy of the list, in a different shape, with its own `isActive`. They had
 * drifted: six links on the landing bar, five in the docs bar, six split
 * across two groups in the mobile menu, so GitHub appeared on the landing
 * page and in the mobile menu but not in the docs bar.
 *
 * Anchor targets are stored as `section`, not as a finished href, because the
 * correct link depends on where you are: `#install` on the landing page,
 * `/#install` anywhere else. `hrefFor` does that; do not hard-code either
 * form.

 * set" and does not claim to be the page.
 *
 * The distinction is not cosmetic. This used to prefix-match and return the
 * same value for both, so on /docs/install/ the Starlight sidebar marked
 * "Installation" as the current page and the "Docs" link here marked itself
 * as the current page too. Two elements claiming aria-current="page" on one
 * document makes a screen reader announce "current page" twice, for two
 * different destinations.

 * Section links are never current here -- on the landing page the scroll spy
 * in scripts/site-nav.ts marks those with "location". */
