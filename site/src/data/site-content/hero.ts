  // The handoff itself, as two agents: a Claude Code session that stopped
  // with work left, and Codex picking it up without being told again. It
  // replaced one editor window with a file tree, an open AGENTS.md and full
  // tool output, which was accurate but too dense to read at a glance.
  //
  // The tool names are the real ones and the order is the real order:
  // recent sessions, then the raw messages of the one found. The session
  // ref is the one the captured server returned (2026-09-24, 0.21.8, in a
  // temporary project); the Claude Code session is synthetic, two messages
  // written for this, like the public demo's. The few words after each
  // tool name summarise what came back; the agents' sentences are written
  // for this panel.
