// Every cell is a claim about someone else's product, so every cell needs
// checking against that product rather than against its reputation. Say when
// the table was last checked, because a matrix with no date is read as current
// forever. Out-of-the-box defaults are the fair comparison, since a row that
// silently assumes a competitor's optional flag is a row that is wrong for
// most of its readers.
//
// Rows where the answer is genuinely mixed get a short phrase rather than a
// tick. A cell reduced to a dash when the truth was 'yes, behind a flag' is
// the kind of error a reader checks once and then stops trusting the whole
// table for.
