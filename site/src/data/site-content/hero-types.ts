// a 300-line guard once the comparison table's types landed, and this was the
// largest self-contained run of them. feedback-types.ts named the comparison
// types as the next candidate; they are 14 lines and would not have cleared
// the guard on their own, so they stayed and the hero moved instead.
//
// `Platform` still lives in types.ts. The import back is type-only and erased
// at compile time, so the cycle is a spelling detail rather than a runtime one.
