/**
 * Find declarations in the Starlight override stack that can never take
 * effect, because a later rule with at least equal weight always wins.
 *
 * B-23 found 28 files, ~4,900 lines and 1,200+ `!important`, with rules
 * resolved purely by load order — "no rule can be changed by editing the file
 * that appears to own it". Rewriting that by hand is how a site breaks.
 *
 * This takes the safe half first: a declaration that is *provably* shadowed
 * contributes nothing to the rendered page, so deleting it cannot change
 * behaviour. Whatever remains after that is the part that genuinely needs
 * judgement, and it is far smaller.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative. It only reports a shadow when the later
 * declaration has:
 *   - the identical selector text (normalised), and
 *   - the identical media/supports context, and
 *   - importance at least as strong,
 * so it never has to reason about whether one selector subsumes another.
 * That undercounts, which is the right direction to be wrong in.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/css-shadowing.mjs            # report
 *   node scripts/css-shadowing.mjs --json     # machine-readable
 *   node scripts/css-shadowing.mjs --max N    # exit 1 above N, for CI
 *
 * The --max form is a ratchet, not a target. It was added because this ran
 * once, in the pull request that wrote it, and then nothing ran it again --
 * so the count it had driven down grew back unnoticed. Set it to the current
 * count; it can only be lowered.
