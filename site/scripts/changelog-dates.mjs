// Does the built changelog page show the dates CHANGELOG.md actually claims?
//
// This exists because the answer was "no" twice in one day, in opposite
// directions, and neither was visible from the source diff:
//
//   1. Every version heading got a `published_at` built from its own
//      heading date, so 0.3.1 was presented as published on 24 Aug 2026
//      while no tag for it existed.
//   2. Fixing that keyed the rule on `unreleased`, which the build-time
//      render sets on *every* entry -- so the no-JS page lost the dates of
//      releases that really had shipped.
//
// Both are markup that renders as something plausible and wrong, on a page
// nobody re-reads, so neither `astro check` nor the a11y pass would ever
// notice. This reads the built HTML and compares it against the source of
// truth. Run after `astro build`.
