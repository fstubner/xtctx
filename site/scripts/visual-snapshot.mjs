/* Pin the look of the built site so a refactor can prove it changed nothing.
 *
 *   node scripts/visual-snapshot.mjs record    # capture the baseline
 *   node scripts/visual-snapshot.mjs check     # capture again, compare
 *
 * Why this exists: the Starlight override layer is being audited declaration
 * by declaration, and the whole premise of that audit is "the site must look
 * identical afterwards". Without a mechanical check, every one of those
 * judgements collapses into "does this still look right to me today", which
 * is how the layer reached 958 !important declarations in the first place.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: a CI gate, and deliberately so. It compares PNG bytes, so
 * it is exact on one machine and meaningless across two -- font rasterisation
 * differs between Windows and the Ubuntu runners, and every capture would
 * differ for reasons that have nothing to do with the CSS. Committing the
 * baselines would also add megabytes of binary churn to a repo whose other
 * guards are all text. So: baselines live in a gitignored directory, and this
 * is a local before/after tool for whoever is doing the refactor.
 *
 * The existing CI gates still cover what they always did -- contrast, dead
 * CSS, axe, the build. This covers the thing none of them can: "did the page
 * move".
 *
 * Byte comparison rather than a perceptual diff is on purpose. Identical
 * input renders to identical bytes, so any difference is real; a tolerance
 * threshold is a knob that eventually gets widened until it passes. When a
 * capture differs, the two PNGs are written side by side for you to look at
 * -- a human deciding "that is the change I meant" is the point, not a
 * number deciding it.

 * Screenshot-settling could never catch it: by the time the frames were
 * compared the window was already the wrong size and perfectly stable.
